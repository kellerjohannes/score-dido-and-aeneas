# Henry Purcell: Dido & Ã†neas

This repository contains the source code of a transcription of Dido & Aeneas. It was made for an opera production at Theater Basel.

In the current state, the transcription represents the 1841 edition with the following exceptions.

- Dynamics are ignored.
- Slurs in the instrumental parts are ignored.

The transcription is in progress. Once the whole piece is done, it will be proofread and tagged. After that, the score will be adapted to the specific needs of the Basel production.
