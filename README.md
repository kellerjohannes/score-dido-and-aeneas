# Henry Purcell: Dido & Ã†neas

This repository contains the source code of a transcription of Dido &
Aeneas. It was made for an opera production at Theater Basel.

In the current state, the transcription represents the 1841 edition
with the following exceptions.

- Dynamics are ignored.
- Slurs in the instrumental parts are ignored.

Names of variables containing musical material use the numbering of
the pieces of the 1841 edition. In the edition, they appear as arabic
numbers, in the variable names they appear as roman numbers, since
variable names in Lilypond cannot contain digits.


The transcription is in progress. Once the whole piece is done, it
will be proofread and tagged. After that, the score will be adapted to
the specific needs of the Basel production.
